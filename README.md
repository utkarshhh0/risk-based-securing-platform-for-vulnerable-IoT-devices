# Risk-Based Securing Platform for Vulnerable IoT Devices

## Project Overview
A Windows-based tool that scans IoT devices on a local network to identify vulnerabilities like default credentials, risky open ports, and outdated firmware, assigns risk scores to prioritize remediation, and offers one-click automated or simulated fixes via a user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Features
- Multi-vulnerability scanning with risk-based device prioritization  
- One-click password updates and service disablement (real or simulated)  
- Lifecycle security warnings for unsupported devices  
- User-definable security policies with enforcement and alerts  
- Interactive dashboard with alerts, logs, and exportable reports  

## Usage
- Scan your local subnet to discover vulnerable IoT devices  
- Review risk scores and vulnerability details per device  
- Apply automated fixes with a single click (simulation mode available)  
- Customize security policies to fit your needs  
- Export reports and logs for auditing  

## Platform
- Windows 11 (x64) desktop application or Electron-based UI  

## Disclaimer
Use responsibly and only scan devices you own or have permission to assess. Unauthorized scanning or remediation may be illegal.
